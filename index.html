    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <p>
      I am an aspiring Information Technology student who is interested in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning.<br><br>
      I am currently 40 years old. I have more than 14 years of experience in urban planning, urban design, town planning, and architectural fields.
      I currently hold a bachelor's degree in urban planning, which I obtained in 2006, in Turkey. I moved to Australia in 2010 and became an Australian citizen in 2014.
      I am married and we are currently expecting our first baby.  <br><br>
      I feel happy while doing outdoor activities with my friends and family. I love camping, fishing, hiking, kayaking, and walking in nature.
      I was even part of a dragon boat racing team where we competed in the 2016 Australian Championships a 2016 Club Crew World Championships.<br><br>
      I love quiet and relaxing weekends with my wife. I also love catching up with a small group of friends and family and having meaningful conversations.

    <h3>Interest in IT?</h3>
    <p> I have always been interested in technology and technological improvements since my childhood.
      Due to financial reasons, we did not have many opportunities to have hands-on experience with technological devices when I was growing up. <br> <br>
      Working with computers, understanding programming languages, and being able to produce something with them was always one of my dreams.  Since my arrival in Australia, I was focusing on earning money to build a life and pay my bills to survive.
      However, I never lost my interest in IT and I kept telling people that one day I will be going out from my current industry and realise my dreams. <br> <br>
      COVID is one of the worst things that recently happened to the world. However, it also created an opportunity for me to spare much needed time to study and chase my dreams.  <br> <br>
      Initially, I enrolled for 1 course to see if I still have the patience to study. After finishing that, I realized that even taking 1 course and achieving good results made me feel accomplished.  Most importantly, I am now one step closer to my dream.
      Therefore, I enrolled in further courses to be able to obtain a Bachelor of Information Technology degree at RMIT in near future.

    <h3>Why did I choose RMIT?</h3>
    <p> RMIT is one of the most reputable universities in the world in Computer Science and Information Systems. Besides, the university provides an online education option to the students which provide flexibility.
      Furthermore, the degree which I will be obtaining from RMIT will also be recognized in other countries if I choose to relocate to another country in the future.
